# "Talent Beyond Boundaries" - a skills based approach to hire diverse talent
A project proposal for the application of data science for social good.

# What is the business need?

There are a number of reasons to help people in a time of need.  Some of them may be considered philanthropic, but there is also the consideration that it is simply the right thing to do.  It makes business sense as well as building a sustainable marketplace that distributes opportunity, protecting itself in the long run by ensuring that there are incentives for everyone to play.  

In terms of talent strategy, this boils down to a strategy of 'Diversity and Inclusion'.  Businesses today who participate in highly competitive markets, such as technology, finance or healthcare, have a very real strategic need to find the best talent, 'rent' their talents for a competitive rate, motivate them to stay and be productive, and also build the diversity of their teams.  Research indicates that businesses that who do this best are the ones who perform and drive innovation.

A quick search on the topic of 'Future of Work' or 'Value of Diversity' will bring a wealth of resources to indicate the modern trends in Human Capital Management in response to a changing world.  Trends such as demand for highly technical skills, a global workforce, remote work, technology, the 'gig economy' are driving macro-economic trends that decentralize the way we hire and reward talent.  Below are a few links to resources that present the need to think differently.

# What needs to be done about it?

Given the market changes, businesses who approach talent sourcing in a more traditional way - i.e. sort through piles of applications to find candidates who fit their local requirements - are all competing for the same limited resources.  One alternative may be to tap into non-traditional markets for talent.  One specific approach may be to actively seek out people with the required skills and capabilities who may have a high incentive to say yes.  Another macro-economic trend that may be a factor is the rise in the global refugee population - people who are either displaced, or living in difficult situations given their geographic location.

Organizations like 'Talent Beyond Boundaries' (https://www.talentbeyondboundaries.org/) or 'Refugee Talent' (https://refugeetalent.com/) are startups that represent the growing trend in refugee placement, and the potential to be using best practices in job matching and artificial intelligence to drive career mobility that reverses the trend in the refugee experience.  Instead of finding themselves in an impossible predicament, refugees have the opportunity to apply their deep technical skills to a market opportunity where they are needed.  It is good for the businesses hiring them, and good for the economy as a whole when people are lifted out of difficult geo-political situations.  Those refugees will find themselves in a more stable position in life and be likely go on to take care of others, all while providing a valued service and improving the diversity balance within the organizations they serve.  It's a win - win - win!
