# A data based approach to hire diverse refugee talent  
Author: Daniel Macdonald @talentrics http://www.talentrics.com/

Current trends in strategic talent management suggest that businesses who seek to build a diverse workforce need to actively embrace trends in globalization, technology, and a de-centralized workforce.  Research such as Deloitte's whitepaper 'Creating Value and Impact Through the Alternative Workforce' point to these market shifts as opportunity for businesses to optmize performance as well as meet social obligations to provide opportunity to a wider population. (Dikau & Hatfield 2020)  As a result multi-national corporations are turnign to people analytics to help source highly competitive skills within hidden pools of talent.

# How would it work?

The recommended approach is to use machine learning and skills ontologies to match refugee talent to current job listings.

The data sources - on the talent supply side, data may come from specially curated databases such as the 'Talent Beyond Boundaries' talent catalog, or via available social media feeds.  Talent demand would be referenced via the Thinknum NYSE Jobs Database, and the matching engine would use a NLP approach such as the 'OpenSkills Project' from Data at work.
