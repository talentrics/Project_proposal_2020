# A data based approach to hire diverse refugee talent  
Author: Daniel Macdonald @talentrics http://www.talentrics.com/

In a recent whitepaper from Deloitte, they present current strategies on 'Creating Value and Impact Through the Alternative Workforce'.  The paper points out 21st market shifts such as rapidly developing technology, market globalization and the need for agile workforce strategies, and highlights the need for businesses to embrace global strategies that take advantage of these shifts. (Dikau & Hatfield 2020). In response, corporations are building teams of data scientists to improve their 'People' processes, using machine learning to guide decision making for talent management.  

This proposal looks at how such organizations may use data science to help drive 'Diversity and Inclusion' programs by hiring people who have been forcibly displaced from their homes.  Such a strategy has the potential to address the business need to hire highly skilled professionals who are committed to work, while also filling a growing social need. (Cousins & Laurie 2019)

# How would it work?

The recommended approach is to use machine learning and skills ontologies to match refugee talent to current job listings.

The data sources - on the talent supply side, data may come from specially curated databases such as the 'Talent Beyond Boundaries' talent catalog, or via available social media feeds.  Talent demand would be referenced via the Thinknum NYSE Jobs Database, and the matching engine would use a NLP approach such as the 'OpenSkills Project' from Data at work.
